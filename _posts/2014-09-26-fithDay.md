## Day Number Five

Finally the weekend is almost here, I thought that I would never see it on Monday. Today we had a guest speaker who showed us how he uses git and git hub at his job. It is really cool to see how the stuff we are being taught now will be what we are doing in our jobs. Friday is an open lab day after the speaker so nothing new is taught, it’s a great day to get caught up on things that you are not understanding or need some help with. 

I spend most of the day getting the basic site to work so that all I needed to do this weekend is add some style. I can’t wait for the next week to start, it can’t come soon enough. With how much fun this class is I wish we didn’t have a weekend!
