## Day Number Three

Today was my first all nighter, the project we had assigned for homework always seems so easy until you go and test it. AND IT DOESN’T WORK! It is so frustrating to think I have everything figured out and it should work and it doesn’t. I started from scratch three times, which sounds stupid but practice make permeant. The more I keep working on the commands and get use to the keyboard the faster I will be.

The project was somewhat easy just had to use git and git hub to make a website, plus we got to use an automatic page generator to set everything up. My links didn't work all night, so I would start over, set everything up in git and go from there. Around 4 in the morning I decided to call it, get a few hours of sleep and get to school early to see if anyone else had the same problem as me.

It took the student that sits next to me 10 minutes to figure out where I was getting stuck and how to help me solve the problem. I am not sure how I feel about that, I thought it would be at least a half an hour. But I am very thankful for the help and info that was causing me to get stuck. Now I really wish I didn't stay up so late pulling my hair out.
