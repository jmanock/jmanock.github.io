## My First Day 

Well, it was something. I never thought that I would be back in school and all day on top of that. Everyone says that Programing Bootcamp is just like the military bootcamp and going in I had my doubts. The first day was a real wakeup call with all the work that we had to do but everyone in my class is really helpful and we are all going to get threw this together. I canâ€™t wait to see what day two brings.
