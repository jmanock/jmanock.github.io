## Day Number Two

Day one in the books, now on to day two. I thought that the first day was hard but it was nothing compared to the second day. At the rate that this is going week to is going to be impossible! We might be learning a lot but what we learn is really useful, that is going to put all of us ahead when we finish. 

Today we learned more git and git hub, two straight days of this and we havenâ€™t even got into the main reason to use git and git hub. I know you have to learn to crawl before you can walk ie: learn the basics before you can get to the more advanced stuff.
