## Day Number Two

Day two was even harder that the first day. I am really getting my moneys worth with all the information being taught. I thought that the first day was hard but the second day was even harder, at the rate this is going next week is going to be impossible! It is not all bad we learned a lot of neat little tricks that will really put us ahead when we all finish.
