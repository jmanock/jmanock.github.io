## Day Number Four

It’s Thursday, almost the weekend got threw hump day and can’t wait to see what our weekend project is going to be. Every week the class is given a project that should take up all of Friday and the weekend. This weekends project is to build our own website using git and git hub. It does’t have to be anything fancy but there has to be links that work and they have to link to the blog post we are creating.

Thinking back redoing the project really helped me with this because I feel really good using git and git hub now. I know that I am not going to have any problems doing this, it all comes down to how much time I want to spend working on it.
