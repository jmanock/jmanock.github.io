## Week Two

So much happened this week! One guy quit, I guess that should be expected, everyone warns you that it is going to be hard work but your definition of hard could be light years off from my definition of hard. I donâ€™t think that we have done anything over the top. No all nighters for me this week. (thank god) the weekends project seemed so easy until you tried to tell the computer to do it. I guess if it was easy to make the computer do things, everyone would be a programmer and that would take out a lot of job. Anyways I go the project done late on Sunday night, not sure if everyone is going to finish.

Week three should be really tough, we are going to learning a lot more complexed javascript. I am excited to learn, the teacher is great and the students are even better. That all equal the best learning environment.
